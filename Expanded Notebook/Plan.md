### **Step 3: Model Development**
   - **3.1. Choose Your Model:**
     - Start with a simple linear regression model to establish a baseline.
     - Experiment with more advanced models, such as Ridge or Lasso regression, to see if they improve performance.

   - **3.2. Model Training:**
     - Train your model on the training data and evaluate it using cross-validation or a hold-out validation set.
     - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

   - **3.3. Model Evaluation:**
     - Predict on the test set and evaluate using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
     - Compare the model's predictions against actual revenue values using line plots or scatter plots.

   - **3.4. Feature Importance Analysis (Optional):**
     - Analyze which features have the most significant impact on predictions, and adjust your model accordingly.

### **Step 4: Visualization and Reporting**
   - **4.1. Visualize Results:**
     - Create visualizations to show how well the model captures seasonal trends and overall revenue predictions.
     - Use side-by-side plots to compare the model's performance with and without seasonal features.

   - **4.2. Document Findings:**
     - Summarize your EDA, modeling approach, and results in a final Jupyter Notebook.
     - Include comments and markdown cells to explain your process and findings clearly.

### **Step 5: Finalize and Share the Project**
   - **5.1. Clean Up Code:**
     - Refactor your code, moving reusable parts into functions or scripts within the `scripts/` directory.
     - Ensure all code is well-documented with comments and docstrings.

   - **5.2. Prepare the Repository:**
     - Ensure your README is updated to reflect the final project.
     - Add any additional files or documentation needed to help others understand and use your work.
     - Push your changes to the remote repository and merge them into the main branch.

   - **5.3. Share Your Project:**
     - Consider sharing your project on LinkedIn, your portfolio, or other professional networks, along with a brief summary of your work.

By following these steps, you'll build a well-structured, reproducible project that clearly demonstrates your skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development.
